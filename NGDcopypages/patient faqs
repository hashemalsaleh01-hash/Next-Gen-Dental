About Dentures and Comfort

Q: Will getting new dentures hurt?
A: The process of getting dentures is generally not painful. We take impressions, measurements, and fittings, which are all non-invasive steps. Minor discomfort may occur as your mouth adjusts to the final denture, but our prosthetist will ensure the fit is as comfortable as possible and provide all necessary adjustments.

Q: How long does the process take from start to finish?
A: The fabrication of a new, high-quality denture requires a series of appointments (as outlined on our Private Denture Process page). Typically, this takes 4 to 6 weeks depending on your specific needs and healing time, if extractions were necessary. This ensures we achieve the best possible fit and aesthetics.

Q: I currently have dentures. How often should I have them checked?
A: We recommend having your dentures professionally examined at least once a year. This allows us to check for wear, fit, and oral health changes, helping you maintain comfort and prevent minor issues from becoming major problems.

Our Services and Turnaround

Q: Can you help with denture repairs or relines?
A: Yes, absolutely. Because we have an on-site lab, we specialize in fast repairs and relines. We offer same-day priority service for most emergency denture repairs and relines when you contact us early in the day.

Q: What is a reline, and do I need one?
A: A reline is the process of adding new base material to the tissue side of your denture. It restores a tight, accurate fit because the shape of your gums and bone naturally changes over time. You may need a reline if your dentures feel loose, cause irritation, or slip when you talk or eat.

Q: Do you offer services other than dentures?
A: Yes, our registered prosthetist can also custom-fit and fabricate appliances such as orthodontic retainers, specialized splints for jaw joint issues, and high-quality custom sports mouthguards.

Consultation and Payment

Q: Is the initial consultation free?
A: Yes. We offer a complimentary, no-obligation initial consultation to discuss your needs, assess your oral health, and provide a clear treatment plan and quotation.

Q: Do you offer payment plans or work with health funds?
A: We aim to make quality care accessible. We work with all major Australian health funds. Please bring your health fund card to your consultation. We can also discuss flexible payment options on a case-by-case basis.
